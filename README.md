# CellPond
CellPond is a slightly-surreal 'cellular automata' engine that I made for fun.

I've made two videos about it! Check them out:<br>
🦠 [**Cells in Cells in Cells**](https://youtu.be/gv40Z9tVjAI)<br>
🤖 [**Nothing**](https://youtu.be/sQYUQNozljo)<br>

And I'm now making a new video about it! Called:<br>
🔮 **Spellular Automata**

## What's the big idea?
CellPond has 2 big ideas:<br>
🐸 You can code it by dragging + dropping shapes.<br>
🐸 Cells can split/merge cells into smaller/bigger cells.

## How can I use it?
You can try it out at [cellpond.cool](https://cellpond.cool)<br>
(sorry no touch controls yet)

Or, you can [download the source code](https://github.com/TodePond/CellPond/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and open `index.html` in a browser.

## How does it work? What do all the shapes do?
It's a secret.
